# Code Refactor Starter Code
Upon opening the Project i noticed that the "Search Engine optimization" section had no ID tag so i added one, i also noticed that the <img> tag on the social media marketing section had a closing tag so i took that out because <img/> tags are self closing tags.
I also changed the footer tag from h2 to h4 so the code is arranged properly
i also added an alt description for the background image
